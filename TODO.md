# Things to do

Keeping this list here so that I don't always need to have access to the internet.

* Increase font size of title in nav bar
* Update title of app on home screen to "Camping!"
* Add typescript linter for editing (or I guess a JS equivalent to rubocop)
* Make startup screen show logo and name
* Pick a font and use consistently in the app
* Set base font size for the app to simplify
* Use better buttons: try https://github.com/ide/react-native-button and https://github.com/APSL/react-native-button
