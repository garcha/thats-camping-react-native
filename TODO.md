# Things to do

Keeping this list here so that I don't always need to have access to the internet.

* Add title for campsite detail page
* Load campsite data from local file (so it's quicker to load and we don't need internet access)
* Increase font size of title in nav bar
* Loading indicator while blank screen?
* Update title of app on home screen to "Camping!"
* Make the about page scrollable
* Add typescript linter for editing (or I guess a JS equivalent to rubocop)
* Make startup screen show logo and name
